# Tiledesk Notes

## Open Questions
- Can Tiledesk automatically insert the user's email into a variable?
- Can we pass custom metadata into webhook payloads from Tiledesk?
- Does Tiledesk support `asyncReply: true` or webhook wait handling?

## Ideas
- Show “typing…” indicator before webhook completes.
- Insert fallback message: “Hang tight, STRUKT is working on your request…”

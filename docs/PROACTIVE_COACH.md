# Proactive AI Coaching Features

## Overview

This implementation adds advanced AI coaching capabilities to the STRUKT system, transforming it into a proactive, intelligent fitness companion. The features include conversational logging, image analysis, personalized planning, and dynamic dashboard insights.

## Database Schema Updates

### New User Profile Fields (Migration: `2025-10-14-add-proactive-coach-fields.sql`)

Extended `user_profiles` table with rich onboarding data:

- `why_statement` (TEXT): User's deep motivation and "why" for their fitness journey
- `success_definition` (TEXT): Personal definition of success  
- `target_event_date` (TIMESTAMPTZ): Date of target event (wedding, competition, etc.)
- `is_pregnant_or_breastfeeding` (BOOLEAN): Medical safety flag
- `is_recovering_from_surgery` (BOOLEAN): Medical safety flag for post-surgery recovery
- `faith_based_diet` (TEXT): Religious dietary requirements (halal, kosher, etc.)
- `relationship_with_food` (TEXT): User's relationship and history with food
- `relationship_with_exercise` (TEXT): User's relationship and history with exercise
- `coaching_persona` (TEXT): Preferred AI coaching style (motivator, strategist, nurturer)
- `anything_else_context` (TEXT): Additional context from onboarding

### Weight Tracking Table

New `weight_logs` table for progress monitoring:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.weight_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  weight_kg NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Includes full RLS policies for user data isolation.

## New Features

### 1. Conversational Logging ("Magic Log")

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/chat` (enhanced)

The chat endpoint now automatically detects when a user wants to log activity from natural language.

**How it works:**
1. User sends message: "I slept 6 hours last night"
2. AI recognizes log intent and extracts entities
3. Automatically creates sleep log in database
4. Returns confirmation: "Thanks for the update. I've logged your sleep. üò¥"

**Supported log types:**
- Meals
- Workouts  
- Sleep
- Mood
- Supplements

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "response": "Got it! I've logged that meal for you. üçΩÔ∏è",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
    "context": {
      "intent": "log_activity",
      "logType": "meal",
      "logId": "uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Image Logging ("Universal Adapter")

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/log-image`

Upload workout screenshots or meal photos for automatic data extraction.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "logType": "workout",  // or "meal"
  "imageUrl": "https://...",  // or use imageBase64
  "imageBase64": "base64string..."
}
```

**Features:**
- **Workout screenshots**: Extracts type, duration, distance, calories from fitness tracker screenshots
- **Meal photos**: Estimates description, calories, macros from food images
- Uses GPT-4o Vision API for intelligent extraction
- Creates structured logs automatically

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "log": { /* created log object */ },
    "extracted": {
      "type": "running",

## Migration

To apply the database schema changes:

1. Run the migration in your Supabase project:
   ```sql

# Airtable Notes

## Key Airtable Logic
- Each logging table links to User via `Email Address`
- AI can fetch personalisation settings for smarter responses
- Onboarding data can be queried using filters like `Email Address = {{email}}`

## Schema Ideas
- Add “First Login Date” to User
- Add “Engagement Score” to track usage

## Upcoming Additions
- Progress tracking (weight, measurements)
- Message history tracking per user
- Weekly Check-In form outputs

## Linked Tables (Current)
- `meals`
- `workouts`
- `sleep_logs`
- (Upcoming: `mood_logs`, `supplements`, `checkins`)
